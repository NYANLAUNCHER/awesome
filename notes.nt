- Keybinds:
  - Super + (h,j,k,l) = navigate current layer in tag
  - Super + {Shift + (j,k) || (u,d)} || (PgDn, PgUp) = navigate (up, down) layers in the current tag
  - Super + Shift + (h,l) = navigate left & right through the tags
  - Super + Shift + c = close client window
  - Super + w = force wibar to top
  - Super + Shift + f = toggle client floating (if (client == floating), then window titlebar = enabled)
  - <> = show title bars
- Wibar = <exit_fullscreen> | <mouse_menu> | <tags> | <current_layer>:<layers> | <clients> | <tray_icon> | <sysinfo> | <layout_menu> | <hide_clients>
  - <exit_fullscreen> = invisible button overlayed on <mouse_menu>, only exists when client is in fullscreen
  - <hide_clients> = like the "show desktop" button on windows
  - <sysinfo> = { <network_status> | <kbdlayout> | <date> | <time> }

    - <kbdlayout> = dropdown to change keyboard layout
  - <tray_icon> = dropdown menu that reveals list of background applications
    - flameshot daemon for screenshots
  - <mouse_menu> = provides access to the (builtin) virtual keyboard, prompts, & actions
- Prompts:

  - client finder = jump to client window, client indexing fmt = "{tag}:{layer}:{index}"
  - layout picker = can apply to list of <tags> or to all tags with '*'
  - workspace manager = save and load workspaces, similar to Zellij
